# ABOUT

This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of colorectal cancer incidence across different countries from 1990 to 2019. By exploring global trends and regional variations, it offers valuable insights into how the incidence of colorectal cancer has evolved over time.

Key highlights:

-   **Maximum Incidence**: The highest incidence rate observed in 2019 was `r paste(max_incidence_country,", at",  round(max_incidence_2019, 2))` cases per 100,000 people. This indicates a significant concentration of colorectal cancer cases in certain countries.

-   **Minimum Incidence**: On the other hand, the lowest incidence rate in 2019 was `r paste(min_incidence_country,", at", round(min_incidence_2019, 2))` cases per 100,000 people, showing areas where colorectal cancer is less prevalent.

-   **Average Incidence**: The global average incidence of colorectal cancer in 2019 is `r paste(round(avg_incidence_2019, 2))`cases per 100,000 people, providing a reference point for comparing individual countries and regions.

Trends Over Time: This dashboard also highlights how the incidence of colorectal cancer has shifted over the years, taking into account changes in healthcare, lifestyle factors, and advancements in detection and prevention. The interactive charts and maps allow users to explore these trends at the global, regional, and country levels.

Data Source: The data used in this analysis comes from the **Global Cancer Observatory (GCO)**, which provides cancer statistics from 185 countries. The dataset includes newly diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer per 100,000 men, offering a global perspective on this common cancer type.

Key Insights: 

-   The interactive maps and charts enable users to identify the countries with the highest and lowest incidence rates.

-   The sparkline widget provides a visual representation of global average trends over time, showing how the incidence has changed between 1990 and 2019.

-   Regional breakdowns allow for comparison across continents, highlighting specific areas that may require more attention in terms of healthcare and cancer prevention.

By visualizing these key metrics, this dashboard aims to raise awareness of colorectal cancer trends and promote public health initiatives targeted at reducing the incidence of this disease globally.
